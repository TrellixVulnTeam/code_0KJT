About
============

The following documentation shows how to use, alter, and build Zhong lab code.
The GitHub repository for the code is located at:

https://github.com/zhong-lab/code

The bulk of the code is written in Python. However, there are small bits and
pieces in C, C++/C#, among others. If you're building a spyrelet or driver,
it should be enough to know Python.

A number of the drivers and spyrelets are written by Dr. David Awschalom's
group.
