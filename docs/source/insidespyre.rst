Spyre
======
Spyre is the package that will allow communication with multiple devices through lantz drivers, and create a experiment GUI.
Immediately inside the spyre folder, there are two primary folders: spyre and testing.

Testing is the folder to run spyrelets from. See :ref:`runspyre`.

Inside the second spyre folder, the only folder that you will likely have to use is "spyrelets".

Inside spyrelets is where the experiment code is.

The following section runs through darkcount_spyrelets.
